        <h2>Dog years vs Human years, What's the difference?</h2>
        <h6>October 2, 2020 by Marc-Anthony Mitchell</h6>

        <p>
             The first year of a <strong>medium-sized</strong> dog's life is 15 years of a human's life. 
             The second year of a dog's life equals about nine years for a human. And after that, 
             every human year equals <strong>approximately</strong> four or five years for a dog. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it's simply not possible for our dogs to live longer than humans. While some hardy pooches can live to the ripe old age of 15 or more, 
            their life expectancy falls well short of our own. However, there's still plenty you can do to help maximize your dog's chances of living a long, happy, 
            and healthy life, and to ensure that they stay comfortable and content well into old age.

         <h2>Are dogs better pets than cats?</h2>
         <h6>October 2, 2020 by Marc-Anthony Mitchell</h6>

         <p>
            Owning a cat isn't really that much different from not owning a cat. They're haughty, they're temperamental and most of the time they act like you don't exist.
            On the other hand, dogs are loyal, cuddly, goofy and best of all, love you no matter what. They come when you call them, shower you with love and are always on the look out.
            Cats on the other hand break your fine china for sport.
         </p>
         <p>
            There's only so much play you can do with your cat. Many cats love to play with string toys and they'll bat their little cat ball toys around, 
            but it's almost like they're humoring you. They can play on their own, not just with people.Dogs absolutely love to play, and it's often interactive 
            play that they want--especially with you. You can play fetch with a ball or a disc. You can enjoy an exciting game of tug-of-war. You can play chase in the yard. 
            If your dog gets along well with other dogs, you can even set up a doggie "playdate" with another pup. Just make sure both dogs are healthy and will get along.
